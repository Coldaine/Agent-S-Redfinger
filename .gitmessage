# Remember to:
#    • Use imperative mood in subject line ("Add" not "Added")
#    • Separate subject from body with a blank line
#    • Limit subject line to 50 characters
#    • Capitalize the subject line
#    • Do not end the subject line with a period
#    • Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#    • Wrap body at 72 characters
#    • Reference issues and PRs in body
#
# --------------------
# Workflow Reminders:
#    ✅ Are you on a feature branch? (not main)
#    ✅ Did you update CHANGELOG.md?
#    ✅ Did you run: python scripts/pre_commit_check.py
#    ✅ Did you test your changes?
#
# See CONTRIBUTING.md for full guidelines
