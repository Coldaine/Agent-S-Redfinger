## üéØ Your Mission

Execute validation testing following the documented procedures. Your goal is to verify:
1. Docker container works correctly
2. Agent S3 can interact with web interfaces
3. Redfinger automation succeeds

**DO NOT** write new code unless absolutely necessary. The implementation is complete.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Information to Read First

### **MUST READ** (15 minutes)

1. **`.claude/CLAUDE.md`** - Read sections:
   - Critical Architecture Understanding
   - Critical Technical Details (especially "BOTH Models MUST Be Vision-Capable")
   - Common Pitfalls & Solutions

2. **This Document** - Read completely before starting

### **Reference as Needed**

- **`docs/VALIDATION_PLAN_DETAILED.md`** - Your main execution guide
- **`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md`** - When you encounter errors
- **`docs/handoffs/11AM.md`** - For implementation details

---

## üß† Deep Think Guidelines

Throughout validation, you will see **üß† DEEP THINK** markers. These indicate:
- Complex issues with multiple possible causes
- Points where careful analysis is required before proceeding
- Situations where guessing will waste time

**When you see üß† DEEP THINK**:
1. **STOP** - Do not rush
2. **READ** the diagnostic steps carefully
3. **VERIFY** each point systematically
4. **DOCUMENT** your findings
5. **REFER** to troubleshooting guide if needed

---

## üìã Execution Checklist

### Phase 0: Preparation (30 minutes)

- [ ] Read `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (Critical sections)
- [ ] Read this entire document
- [ ] Verify Docker Desktop is installed and running
- [ ] Navigate to `C:\Agent-S-Redfinger`
- [ ] Verify all critical files exist (see Pre-Flight Checklist in validation plan)
- [ ] Have VNC Viewer downloaded (optional but recommended)

### Phase 1: Docker Build (30 minutes)

Follow: `docs/VALIDATION_PLAN_DETAILED.md` ‚Üí Phase 1

- [ ] Build Docker image: `docker-compose build --no-cache`
- [ ] Verify image created successfully
- [ ] **If fails**: See `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md` ‚Üí "Image Build Fails"

### Phase 2: Container Validation (45 minutes)

Follow: `docs/VALIDATION_PLAN_DETAILED.md` ‚Üí Phase 2

- [ ] Test 2.1: Basic container launch
- [ ] Test 2.2: Virtual display check (MUST be 1920x1080)
- [ ] Test 2.3: PyAutoGUI screen size (MUST be 1920x1080)
- [ ] Test 2.4: Agent S3 imports
- [ ] Test 2.5: Browser launch

**Critical**: All three (Xvfb, PyAutoGUI, browser) MUST report 1920x1080. If not, coordinate system will be broken.

**If ANY test fails**: See `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md` ‚Üí "Docker Issues"

### Phase 3: API Validation (15 minutes)

Follow: `docs/VALIDATION_PLAN_DETAILED.md` ‚Üí Phase 3

üß† **DEEP THINK CHECKPOINT**: This is the most common failure point. Read the warning in the validation plan.

- [ ] Check current configuration (.env file)
- [ ] Test ZAI API connection
- [ ] (If ZAI fails) Test OpenAI API connection
- [ ] Verify models are vision-capable (glm-4.5v has 'v', GPT-5 includes date)

**If API tests fail**: See `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md` ‚Üí "API Authentication Fails" (has detailed deep-think diagnostics)

**CRITICAL**: Both REASONER_MODEL and VISION_MODEL MUST be vision-capable. Text-only models will fail.

### Phase 4: Simple Functionality (30 minutes)

Follow: `docs/VALIDATION_PLAN_DETAILED.md` ‚Üí Phase 4

- [ ] Test 4.1: Screenshot capability
- [ ] Test 4.2: Browser navigation

**These should be straightforward if Phases 1-3 passed.**

### Phase 5: Full Integration (45 minutes)

Follow: `docs/VALIDATION_PLAN_DETAILED.md` ‚Üí Phase 5

üß† **DEEP THINK CHECKPOINT**: Multiple systems interact here. Read the checkpoint in validation plan.

- [ ] Test 5.1: Simple Google search task
- [ ] Test 5.2: VNC connection (optional but very helpful)

**Expected**: Agent should take at least one action (mouse move, click, or keyboard input)

**If agent does nothing**: See `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md` ‚Üí "Agent Does Nothing"

**If clicks miss targets**: üß† **DEEP THINK** - See validation plan Phase 5 checkpoint and troubleshooting guide "Clicks Miss Targets"

### Phase 6: Redfinger Testing (30 minutes)

Follow: `docs/VALIDATION_PLAN_DETAILED.md` ‚Üí Phase 6

üß† **DEEP THINK CHECKPOINT**: You are now testing the actual use case. Read the checkpoint in validation plan.

- [ ] Test 6.1: Verify Redfinger credentials
- [ ] Test 6.2: Test Redfinger page load
- [ ] Test 6.3: Full Redfinger automation task

**If Redfinger tests fail but Phase 5 (Google) worked**: Issue is Redfinger-specific, not Agent S3. See `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md` ‚Üí "Redfinger-Specific Issues"

---

## üö® When Things Go Wrong

### Decision Tree

```
Issue occurs
    ‚Üì
Is there a üß† DEEP THINK marker nearby?
    YES ‚Üí Read the diagnostic steps carefully
    NO ‚Üí Continue below
    ‚Üì
Is it a Docker issue? (container won't start, image won't build)
    YES ‚Üí docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md ‚Üí "Docker Issues"
    NO ‚Üí Continue below
    ‚Üì
Is it an API issue? (authentication, model not found, vision errors)
    YES ‚Üí docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md ‚Üí "API & Model Issues"
    NO ‚Üí Continue below
    ‚Üì
Is it an agent behavior issue? (does nothing, wrong actions, loops)
    YES ‚Üí docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md ‚Üí "Agent Behavior Issues"
    NO ‚Üí Continue below
    ‚Üì
Is it Redfinger-specific? (page won't load, login fails, canvas not found)
    YES ‚Üí docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md ‚Üí "Redfinger-Specific Issues"
    NO ‚Üí Check troubleshooting guide table of contents
```

### Escalation Criteria

**Escalate to senior engineer if**:
- Multiple troubleshooting procedures attempted with no progress
- Both API providers fail with valid keys and working network
- Coordinate system verified correct but clicks still consistently miss
- Redfinger web structure has fundamentally changed

**Before escalating**, complete the checklist in `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md` ‚Üí "Escalation Checklist"

## üéì Key Concepts to Understand

### 1. The Four-Layer Stack

```
Windows PC (Layer 1)
    ‚Üì
Docker Ubuntu Container (Layer 2)
    - Xvfb virtual display at 1920x1080
    - Chromium browser full-screen at (0,0)
    - Agent S3 Python process
    ‚Üì
Redfinger Web UI (Layer 3)
    - Browser shows Redfinger interface
    - Canvas element displays Android screen
    ‚Üì
Android VM in Cloud (Layer 4)
    - Actual Android device in Redfinger datacenter
```

**Why this matters**: Troubleshooting requires identifying WHICH layer has the problem.

### 2. The Coordinate System

**Critical Rule**: Virtual display (Xvfb), PyAutoGUI, and browser viewport MUST all be 1920x1080.

**Why**: Agent S3 uses screen-absolute coordinates. If browser is at (0,0) and screen is 1920x1080, then clicking at (100, 200) in PyAutoGUI clicks at (100, 200) in browser.

**If mismatched**: Clicks will miss targets by consistent offset.

### 3. Vision Models Requirement

**Both models need vision**:
- **Reasoner**: Gets raw screenshot ‚Üí Plans what to do
- **Grounding**: Gets screenshot + plan ‚Üí Outputs pixel coordinates

**Valid vision models**:
- ‚úÖ glm-4.5v (note the 'v')
- ‚úÖ gpt-5-2025-08-07
- ‚úÖ gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07

**Text-only models (will fail)**:
- ‚ùå glm-4.6 (no 'v')
- ‚ùå gpt-4-turbo (no date/vision indicator)

### 4. VNC Debugging

**What it is**: VNC lets you see the virtual display in real-time

**Why it's useful**: You can WATCH the agent work - see what it sees, where it clicks

**How to use**:
1. Ensure `ENABLE_VNC=true` in .env
2. Connect VNC Viewer to `localhost:5900`
3. Watch the Ubuntu desktop as agent runs
4. See exactly where clicks land vs where they should land

## üìù Documentation Requirements

As you execute validation, maintain a `VALIDATION_RESULTS.md` file with:

### For Each Phase
- Test name
- Result (Pass/Fail)
- Error messages (if any)
- Time taken
- Notes/observations

### Example Entry
```markdown
## Phase 2: Container Validation

### Test 2.1: Basic Container Launch
- **Result**: ‚úÖ Pass
- **Time**: 3 minutes
- **Output**: All 4 startup steps shown, container ready
- **Notes**: VNC port 5900 confirmed open

### Test 2.2: Virtual Display Check
- **Result**: ‚úÖ Pass
- **Time**: 1 minute
- **Output**: dimensions: 1920x1080 pixels
```

### If Test Fails
Document:
1. Exact error message
2. What you tried to fix it
3. What ultimately worked (or didn't)
4. Reference to troubleshooting guide section used

---

## üîí Security Reminders

The `.env` file contains:
- OpenAI API key (starts with sk-proj-)
- ZAI API key (starts with hex characters)
- Redfinger account email and password

**NEVER**:
- Commit .env to public repository
- Share .env contents in logs or screenshots
- Include API keys in error reports

**If credentials exposed**: Rotate immediately

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Right Now

1. **Read** `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (15 minutes)
   - Focus on: Architecture, Critical Technical Details, Common Pitfalls

2. **Verify** Docker is running
   ```powershell
   docker --version
   docker ps
   ```

3. **Navigate** to project
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Agent-S-Redfinger
   ```

4. **Open** `docs/VALIDATION_PLAN_DETAILED.md`
   - This is your step-by-step execution guide

5. **Begin** Phase 1: Docker Build
   ```bash
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   ```

### While Building (5-10 minutes wait time)

- Set up VNC Viewer (optional): https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/
- Review `.env` file (DO NOT share contents)
- Prepare `VALIDATION_RESULTS.md` template
- Review troubleshooting guide table of contents

---

## üí° Tips for Success

### Do's
- ‚úÖ Follow validation plan sequentially
- ‚úÖ Document everything as you go
- ‚úÖ Stop and think at üß† DEEP THINK markers
- ‚úÖ Use VNC to watch agent work
- ‚úÖ Refer to troubleshooting guide when stuck
- ‚úÖ Verify coordinate system carefully (1920x1080 everywhere)
- ‚úÖ Test both API providers if one fails

### Don'ts
- ‚ùå Skip phases (they build on each other)
- ‚ùå Guess at solutions (wastes time)
- ‚ùå Change code without understanding the issue
- ‚ùå Rush through üß† DEEP THINK checkpoints
- ‚ùå Ignore coordinate mismatches
- ‚ùå Use text-only models (need vision!)
- ‚ùå Commit .env to repository

---

## üìñ Additional Context

### Why This Project Exists

Previous attempts to automate Redfinger failed due to:
1. Using Agent-S as a library on Windows (coordinate issues)
2. Browser window positioning causing coordinate translation complexity
3. Not understanding Agent S3's intended architecture (OSWorld benchmark)

**Current approach solves this** by running Agent S3 in its native environment (Linux with virtual display), where browser at (0,0) makes coordinates work perfectly.

### What Makes This Challenging

1. **Four-layer virtualization**: Windows ‚Üí Docker ‚Üí Browser ‚Üí Cloud Android
2. **Coordinate precision**: Must maintain 1:1 screen-to-browser mapping
3. **Vision model requirement**: Both reasoner and grounding need image input
4. **API complexity**: Multiple providers, model versions, vision capabilities

### What Success Looks Like

Agent should:
- Open browser to Redfinger URL
- Identify login fields
- Enter credentials
- Navigate to Android interface
- Identify and click Android elements
- Complete simple tasks (e.g., "open settings")

Even partial success (e.g., successful login) validates the core architecture.

## üéì Learning Resources

If you encounter concepts you don't understand:

- **Docker**: Container = isolated Linux environment
- **Xvfb**: Virtual display (runs without physical monitor)
- **VNC**: Remote desktop protocol (view virtual display)
- **PyAutoGUI**: Python library for GUI automation (clicks, typing)
- **Playwright**: Browser automation library
- **Agent S3**: AI agent that uses vision models to interact with GUIs
- **OSWorld**: Benchmark for GUI automation that Agent S3 was designed for
